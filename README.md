# Sequence-Matrix-Alignment
Sequence-Matrix Alignment is a C++ program that efficiently aligns a given sequence into a matrix, minimizing the absolute sum of differences between sequence elements and matrix values. It employs recursion and dynamic programming to traverse all possible paths, providing optimal alignment solutions.
